Book Roulette is a Python/Flask web app that utilizes the Project Gutenberg book database. Every time the user clicks either the download or browser button in the HTML it generates a randomly chosen book. The Project Gutenberg API itemizes all books by number, so I created a Python formula to work within their catalog and choose one at random. 

The front-end is HTML/CSS and is deployed on Heroku.
